# Configure QLever UI

Assuming that you already have a QLever Instance running and super user created you can now configure your existing QLever backend in you new QLever UI instance. 

You may access the admin panel by adding `/admin` to the URL you are using for your QLever UI instance and login with the credentials you just created.

If you don't have a QLever instance readily available to key in or just want to get up and running as fast as possible, you can use our [example settings](/resources/) that use a QLever instance with Wikidata KB hosted at the Chair of Algorithms and Data Structures at the University of Freiburg.  

Click "Backends" and "Add backend" in order to start configuring your first QLever backend. There are many help texts below each configuration box that guide you through the process. If you are done save the settings and reload the QLever UI interface.

You can also import the respective `*-sample.csv` file for the example backend.

If everything worked correctly you should see backend details displayed on top right of the regular QLever UI. If not you can enable details error logging in the user interface (in top right dropdown menu) and open your browsers developer console to see the outputs.
